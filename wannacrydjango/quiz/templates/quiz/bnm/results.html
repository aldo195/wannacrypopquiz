        <h3>Why?</h3>
        <p>
           By not having network monitoring in place at all, you are relying on a “prevention only” approach to
            Information Security. This approach is very risky because a significant amount of malware and hacking
            tools will bypass your antivirus, no matter how “next generation” it is.
        </p>
        <h3>What's next?</h3>
        <p>
           You need to have a shot at spotting breaches in your security between the time the malware gets passed your
            antivirus and the time the FBI notifies you that many of your customers are having their identities stolen
            and you’re to blame. Luckily, there some easy ways to get started with basic network monitoring. Start by
            setting up a dedicated email distribution list that will receive email notifications of threat detections.
            Then ask your firewall vendor for help sending high priority detections to that email distribution list, or
            consider signing up for OpenDNS and set their detections to go to your notification distribution list.
        </p>
    {% endif %}
    {% if drill.reason == "too long to notify" %}
        <h3>Why?</h3>
        <p>
            Over three hours have passed since your network experienced what <b>looks</b> like WannaCry ransomware.
            You’re in a dangerous situation because you think that someone is watching your network while clearly they’re not.
        </p>
        <h3>What's next?</h3>
        <p>
           Perform a step by step review of how your network monitoring solution should have caught this activity and
            alerted you to the threat. Find where the failure was, fix it, and repeat the exercise.
        </p>
    {% endif %}
    {% if drill.reason == "moderate time to notify" %}
        <h3>Why?</h3>
        <p>
           It took a while but eventually you were notified on what looked like ransomware in your network. That’s good
            but there may be some tweaks you can make that will enable you to shut down threats faster and minimize the
            damage they do to your organization.
        </p>
        <h3>What's next?</h3>
        <p>
           Review the expected detection/notification times for each step of your network monitoring procedure. What
            process changes can be made to catch things faster? If you’re using a managed services provider, this is
            also a good opportunity to examine the SLAs they’ve agreed to and whether they’re holding up their end.
        </p>
    {% endif %}
    {% if drill.reason == "short time to notify" %}
        <h3>Why?</h3>
        <p>
            Your network monitoring spotted the red flag and quickly let you know about it. That’s awesome!
        </p>
        <h3>What's next?</h3>
        <p>
            Awareness is not the final step in taking down a ransomware outbreak. You need to be positioned to quickly and effectively
            stop the infection from spreading. We’ll be adding Incident Response drills soon, in the meanwhile check how well you’re proactively
            preventing outbreaks in the <a href="/drill/1/1/">Basic Workstation Inventory</a> drill.
