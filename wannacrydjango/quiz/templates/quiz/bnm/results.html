        <h3>Why?</h3>
        <p>
           You have more than a few cases of these headliner vulnerabilities in your network. This is a strong signal
            that no one has been watching for security holes until now.
        </p>
        <h3>What's next?</h3>
        <p>
           Drop everything and get these vulnerabilities fixed before it's too late.
            Afterwards, apply strategic thought as to how you need to change vulnerability management at your organization.
        </p>
    {% endif %}
    {% if drill.reason == "single case" %}
        <h3>Why?</h3>
        <p>
           You have some very famous, very noticeable, vulnerabilities in your network.
            Probably no one has been watching for security holes until now, or they haven’t been taking it seriously.
        </p>
        <h3>What's next?</h3>
        <p>
           Get these vulnerabilities resolved, confirm that they're gone with another scan, and afterwards apply
            strategic thought on improving (or creating) the
            vulnerability management program at your organization.
        </p>
    {% endif %}
    {% if drill.reason == "no cases" %}
        <h3>Why?</h3>
        <p>
            That’s a relief! You haven’t spotted these celebrity vulnerabilities in your network, and that’s a good sign.
        </p>
        <h3>What's next?</h3>
        <p>
            Take a minute to celebrate a bit and then continue on to the next drill. It’s possible that you have these
            or other high risk vulnerabilities in your network but your scans aren’t picking up on them. Improving your
            scan coverage should be your next step.
