        <p>
            Follow this process to enable authenticated scanning and <a href="mailto:info@valhalla.io"reach out</p>a> if you need any help:
            <ol>
                <li>Create a dedicated admin user on the Active Directory domain, you can call it "scanner_user"</li>
                <li>Configure your scanner to use this user to log in to all Windows hosts</li>
                <li>Run a test scan against one Windows host that you know is on the domain</li>
                <li>Check the test scan results and confirm that the scanner was able to authenticate</li>
                <li>Configure all future scans to use this test user</li>
                <li>Watch for authentication failures in future scans, in case the user's password expires</li>
            </ol>

                    <p>Your network scanner doesn't log in (authenticate) to Windows computers to check them for security holes.
                        Authentication is necessary for checking version numbers for most applications, for example.
            All patching solutions are far from perfect and you probably have hosts with configuration issues that need fixing.
            Without authenticated scanning you're going to miss critical vulnerabilities that hackers and malware will target.
