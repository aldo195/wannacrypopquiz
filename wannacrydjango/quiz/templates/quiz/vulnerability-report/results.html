        <h3>Why?</h3>
        <p>
           Without a vulnerability report, you're not going to know about security holes in your network. That means that
            the next hacker or malware that targets your organization is going to have an easy time taking over systems
            and stealing data.
        </p>
        <h3>What's next?</h3>
        <p>
           There are many options for getting your network scanned for vulnerabilities and their pricing depends on how
            much of the heavy lifting you want to do yourself. Top options include
            <a href="https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus-vulnerability-scanner">Nessus<a>,
                <a href="https://www.qualys.com/free-trial/">Qualys</a>,
                <a href="http://www.openvas.org/setup-and-start.html">OpenVAS</a> and
                <a href="https://www.rapid7.com/products/nexpose/">Rapid7</a>.
                If you’re agnostic and pressed for time, get the Rapid7 Nexpose which has a
                <a href="https://www.rapid7.com/products/nexpose/download/">free 30 day trial</a>.</p>
        <p>If you already have a Managed Services Provider and they haven’t done a vulnerability scan for you in the last year-
            strongly consider switching to a more security-conscious provider. I can also recommend some of our
            highly-ranked partners for you to consider. </p>
        </p>
    {% endif %}
    {% if drill.reason == "no auth" %}
        <h3>Why?</h3>
        <p>
            You're network scanner doesn't log into Windows computers to check them for security holes. Believe me,
            patching solutions are far from perfect and you probably have some configuration issues that need fixing.
            Without authenticated scanning you're going to miss critical vulnerabilities that hackers won't miss.
        </p>
        <h3>What's next?</h3>
        <p>
            Follow this process to enable authenticated scanning and reach out if you need any help:
            <ol>
                <li>Create a dedicated admin user on the Active Directory domain, you can call it "scanner_user"</li>
                <li>Configure your scanner to use this user to log in to all Windows hosts</li>
                <li>Run a test scan against one Windows host that you know is on the domain</li>
                <li>Check the test scan results and confirm that the scanner was able to authenticate</li>
                <li>Configure all future scans to use this test user</li>
                <li>Watch for authentication failures in future scans, in case the user's password expires</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
    {% endif %}
    {% if drill.reason == "has eternal blue" %}
        <h3>Why?</h3>
        <p>
            You have the Eternal Blue vulnerability on your network, this is what WannaCry ransomware used to wreak havoc
            and many more worms and hackers will be targeting this vulnerability in the future. It doesn't take much
            to take over a computer that doesn't have a security patch for Eternal Blue.
        </p>
        <h3>What's next?</h3>
        <p>
            I recommend looking at this from both a tactical and a strategic perspective. Tactically, you should patch
            any affected systems right away. For an easier time at this, you can push Microsoft security update 4013389
            (MS17-010) through GPO and then run a scan that looks just for this vulnerability. Connect to any systems
            still showing up as vulnerable in order to address their issue on an individual basis.
        </p>
        <p>
            Strategically, you should change how you're keeping systems up to date and how you're regularly looking for
            security holes in your network. Until you've addressed your critical vulnerabilities, increase scan frequency
            to once every two weeks. Your Managed Services Provider (MSP) can help, or reach out using the form below and
            I'll provide guidance through phone or email.
        </p>

        {% if drill.reason == "passed" %}
        <h3>Why?</h3>
        <p>
            We're off to a good start. By having authenticated scans, you've set the a strong foundation but there's
            still much more we need to review before you can consider your proactive vulnerability assessment security
            layer to be completed.
