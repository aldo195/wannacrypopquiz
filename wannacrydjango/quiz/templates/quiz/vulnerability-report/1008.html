                    <p>Scanner pricing depends on how much of the heavy lifting you want to do yourself. The OpenVAS solution
                        is open source and free but set up is complicated and support is provided through third parties
                        and community forums. The paid solutions are around $2,000 for an annual scan license but small
                        businesses (under 250 devices) may be able to get discount rates of around $300. Annual licenses
                        should cover an unlimited number of scans.
