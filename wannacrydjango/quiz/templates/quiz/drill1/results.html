        <h3>Why?</h3>
        <p>
           You don’t have good visibility into the workstations you’re trying to protect.
           It’s almost certain that your computers are suffering from serious security holes that hackers can
           use to breach your network and compromise your data.
        </p>
        <h3>What's next?</h3>
        <p>
           Reconfigure your vulnerability scanning solution or work with an MSP that can do it for you.
           Configuration should take less than an hour and the scan itself a few hours depending on the size of the
           network. When you have a more complete report, retry this drill.
        </p>
    {% endif %}
    {% if drill.reason == "decent active and bad auth" %}
        <h3>Why?</h3>
        <p>
           You're missing a bunch of workstations in your scans, and your scanner is having trouble
           logging in and checking your computers from the inside.
           That’s like a doctor that needs to diagnose an illness over the phone.
           You can bet that your computers are suffering from serious security holes that hackers can
           use to breach your network and compromise your data.
        </p>
        <h3>What's next?</h3>
        <p>
            Configure your scanner so that it's scanning when all or most of your workstations are
           Online and accessible to it. Ensure that the scanner has valid administrator credentials for logging into the
           workstations.
           When you have a more complete report, retry this drill.
        </p>
    {% endif %}
    {% if drill.reason == "decent active and auth" %}
        <h3>Why?</h3>
        <p>
            You have partial results which means you should dig into the report and identify what is causing a number of workstations to be missed, a number of login attempts to be rejected. Remember that workstations that are powered off or disconnected when the scan takes place will not be inspected. Also, if the scanner fails to log in at a workstation then that workstation is probably suffering from multiple security holes that no one (except the hackers) will know about.
        </p>
        <h3>What's next?</h3>
        <p>
            Contact your security team or Managed Services Provider to review the report details and find which hosts or subnets are missing from the scan and why. Configure your scanner so that it's scanning when all or most of your workstations are online and accessible to it. Ensure that the scanner has valid administrator credentials for logging into the workstations.
            When you have a more complete report, retry this drill. In the meanwhile, get a sense of how much danger is in the vulnerabilities that this scan was able to identify by running the drill for “Do I Have Really Bad Security Holes In My Network”.
        </p>

    {% if drill.reason == "good active and bad auth" %}
        <h3>Why?</h3>
        <p>
            You're doing a good job finding the workstations in your scans but your scanner is having trouble logging in and checking your computers from the inside.

    {% if drill.reason == "good active and good auth" %}
        <h3>Why?</h3>
        <p>
            Way to go, it looks like your team is doing a good job scanning the network for active workstations and authenticating to them in order to identify security holes. Now that you have a sense for what is on the network you can start making sure that major security holes are actually being closed by your team.
        </p>
        <h3>What's next?</h3>
        <p>
            Run the next drill to find the answer to the question “Do I Have Really Bad Security Holes In My Network”.
