    <h1>Basic Workstation Inventory (Step 4/4)</h1>
    <p>You’ve almost finished reviewing your workstation inventory, this is last step and the trickiest!</p>
    <p>Vulnerability scanning is largely dependent on the scanner being able to see “inside” the computers for
        security holes like missing security patches and users with blank passwords. That means that the scanner
        needs to log in at each computer using a valid username and password. This is known as “authentication”
        and failed authentication means that the most critical vulnerabilities may not show up in the report. </p>
    <p>The only thing worse than not protecting your systems is thinking that you’re protecting them when you’re
        actually not. </p>
    <p>Most scan solutions will include authentication results, either in the summary or as a separate report.
        For example, the following Qualys scan had two (2) successful logins. </p>
    <p>Pro Tip: Most scanners will count “null sessions” as successful authentication. This sort of Windows login
        is very restricted and can give a false impression of good logins. You can identify this situation by
        searching the report for the username that the scanner is using to log in to each host. If you don’t see
        that username mentioned in the report, it’s probably failing to log in and you should reduce or zero out
        your successful authentication count. Null session logins can look like this:</p>
    <p>If you are unsure of your authentication results, ask for help in the forums or contact support.</p>
